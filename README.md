# team-awesome-budget
A small program to keep track of Team Awesome's budget

This program will be written in Python. Eventually I would like to have an HTML interface since my wife loves Mac and I'm using both Linux and Windows.

If possible I would like to be able to import records directly from our shared bank account but due to security concerns I'll probably leave this out.

I understand there are a bunch of programs and applications out there that do this, but I'm new to programming and want something to experiment with.
